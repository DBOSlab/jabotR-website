## Overview

`jabotR` is an R package for exploring plant specimen collections from the [JABOT online herbarium collections](https://jabot.jbrj.gov.br/v3/consulta.php), hosted by the [Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](https://www.gov.br/jbrj/pt-br). The package interacts with the JABOT Integrated Publishing Toolkit ([IPT IPT](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/jabot)) by readily downloading full specimen records in Darwin Core Format. It also provides functions to summarize and filter data by taxonomic or geographical criteria.

## The JABOT

JABOT is an online system for managing scientific collections housed in herbaria, research laboratory networks at botanical institutions, and living collections in botanical gardens. From a management perspective, it offers curators, sub-curators, and herbarium staff a variety of tools for administration, productivity monitoring, and report generation. The platform allows users to input and publish specimen data and images, with built-in features for analyzing and improving data quality.
