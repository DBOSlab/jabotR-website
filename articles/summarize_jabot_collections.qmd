Here we present a complete guide to the `jabot_summary()` function of the `jabotR` package. This function provides summary statistics for plant specimen records available in the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden's JABOT online managing herbarium collection system and published via the Integrated Publishing Toolkit [(IPT)](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/jabot).

## Function Overview

The `jabot_summary()` function retrieves summary information for one or more JABOT-associated herbarium collections. It allows users to filter collections and optionally save the summary as a CSV file. It also provides metadata such as the number of records, publication version and date, and a direct link to each herbarium's IPT page.

## Arguments

| Argument    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `herbarium` | A character vector of herbarium acronyms (e.g., `"RB"`, `"K"`). Use `NULL` to summarize all collections. |
| `verbose`   | Logical. If `TRUE`, messages describing summary progress will be shown. |
| `save`      | Logical. If `TRUE`, the summary will be saved as a CSV file. |
| `dir`       | Directory path to save the file. Default is `"jabot_summary"`. |

## Summarize All JABOT Collections

Use the function with default settings to get a summary of all collections, including the herbarium acronym, curator's contact, record count, and a direct IPT link:

```r
summary_df <- jabot_summary(
  verbose = TRUE,
  save = TRUE,
  dir = "jabot_summary"
)
```

## Summarize Specific Collections

Specify one or more herbaria with the `herbarium` argument:

```r
summary_some_df <- jabot_summary(
  herbarium = c("AFR", "R", "RB"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  save = TRUE,
  dir = "jabot_summary"
)
```

## Save Summary to Custom Directory

You can customize the output directory for the summary file:

```r
jabot_summary(
  herbarium = "RB",
  verbose = TRUE,
  save = TRUE,
  dir = "custom_summary"
)
```

## Disable Verbose Output

Suppress progress messages with `verbose = FALSE`:

```r
jabot_summary(
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Additional Tips

- The summary includes fields such as collection code, record count, repatriation status, contact information, and a link to the IPT entry.
- Use this summary to filter or preview collections before downloading or parsing records.
- If `save = TRUE`, the function will automatically store the results in CSV format.
