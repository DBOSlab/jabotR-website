Here we present a complete guide to the `jabot_download()` function of the `jabotR` package. This function allows users to retrieve plant specimen records in Darwin Core Format from the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden's JABOT online managing herbarium collection system.

## Function Overview

The `jabot_download()` function downloads specimen data for all or specific JABOT-associated herbarium collections. It offers flexibility through several arguments.

## Arguments

| Argument    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `herbarium` | A character vector of herbarium acronyms (e.g., `"RB"`, `"K"`). Use `NULL` to download all collections. |
| `repatriated` | Logical. If `FALSE`, repatriated herbaria will be skipped. Use `jabot_summary()` to identify them. |
| `verbose`   | Logical. If `TRUE`, messages describing download progress will be shown. |
| `dir`       | Directory path to save the files. Default is `"jabot_download"`. |

## Download All JABOT Specimen Records

Use the function with default settings to download all JABOT data.

```r
jabot_download(
  verbose = TRUE, 
  dir = "jabot_download"
)
```

## Download Specimens from Selected Collections

Specify collection codes with the `herbarium` argument:

```r
jabot_download(
  herbarium = c("AFR", "R", "RB"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  dir = "jabot_download"
)
```

## Skipping Repatriated Collections

To exclude collections marked as repatriated:

```r
jabot_download(
  repatriated = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  dir = "jabot_download"
)
```

## Example: Custom Directory Without Verbose Messages

```r
jabot_download(
  herbarium = "RB",
  verbose = FALSE,
  dir = "custom_directory"
)
```

## Additional Tips

- Use `jabot_summary()` to inspect which collections are available and whether they are repatriated.
- Ensure internet access is available when running `jabot_download()`.
- Review the contents of the downloaded folder to verify `occurrence.txt` and metadata presence.
